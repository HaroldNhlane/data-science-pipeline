🏠 California Housing Price Prediction A comprehensive machine learning project that predicts housing prices in California using various regression techniques. This project demonstrates the complete data science workflow from exploratory data analysis to model deployment.
📊 Project Overview
This project utilizes the California Housing dataset to build predictive models that estimate median house values based on various demographic and geographic features. The implementation covers data exploration, feature engineering, multiple machine learning algorithms, and model evaluation.

🎯 Key Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Comprehensive analysis of feature distributions and correlations

Multiple Regression Models: Comparison of various algorithms including Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, and more

Feature Engineering: Handling of geographical features and data preprocessing

Model Evaluation: Detailed performance metrics and visualization

Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimization of model parameters for best performance

📁 Dataset Description
The dataset contains 20,640 samples with 8 feature variables:

Feature	Description
MedInc	Median income in block group
HouseAge	Median house age in block group
AveRooms	Average number of rooms per household
AveBedrms	Average number of bedrooms per household
Population	Block group population
AveOccup	Average number of household members
Latitude	Block group latitude
Longitude	Block group longitude
Target Variable: Median house value for California districts (in hundreds of thousands of dollars)
